WP REST API enhancement to return JSON arrays containing localized strings registered with WordPress' wp_localize_script() function

== Description ==

WP REST API enhancement to return JSON arrays containing localized strings registered with WordPress' wp_localize_script() function

== Usage ==

1. Install & Activate Plugin
1. Specify which localized scripts are allowed to be returned via the API using the *allowed_restful_localized_scripts* filter
1. Go to endpoint `/wp-json/shawnhooper/v1/localized/` to see all scripts
1. Go to endpoint `/wp-json/shawnhooper/v1/localized/<script_handle>` to see a specific script.

== Specifying Which Scripts Are Allowed ==

By default, no scripts are allowed to be returned by the API.

To specify specific scripts that are allowed to be returned via the API:

<pre>add_filter('allowed_restful_localized_scripts', function($allowed) {
	array_push($allowed, 'my_script_name');
	array_push($allowed, 'my_second_script_name');
	return $allowed;
});</pre>

To allow all scripts to be returned via the API:

`add_filter('allowed_restful_localized_scripts', '__return_true');`
